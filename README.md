# Apps
This git contains the apk and mk files needed to include apps on Securegen.
The reason why these applications were chosen can be viewed on our wiki avaiable at https://gpopai.usp.br/wiki/doku.php

# How to add Apps to build

To add all apps on this repo to the build, just run addPacks.sh.

If you don't want one of the apps, remove its name from secGenPacks.txt.

If you want to add an app, download its apk, create a .mk file like the ones on this repo and add its name to sceGenPacks.txt.
